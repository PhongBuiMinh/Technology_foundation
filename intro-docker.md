# 🐳 Docker Essentials

Docker sets up an isolated environment to run an application.

## 🔍 What That Means

- Docker packages your app along with all its dependencies (libraries, tools, configs) into a **container**.
- This container runs in a lightweight, isolated environment—like a mini virtual machine, but faster and more efficient.
- The environment is defined by a **Docker image**, which acts as a blueprint for the container.

## 🛠️ Create Docker Image with Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a **DSL (Domain Specific Language)** for defining how to build an image.

### Steps

1. Create a `Dockerfile`.
2. Add instructions and commands.
3. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -f /path/to/Dockerfile -t <new_image> /path/to/build_context
	```
	The build context is the folder Docker uses to locate files for COPY and ADD. Docker sends  the entire context to the daemon.
4. Run the image to create a container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/wdr -w /wdr image  # Links host directory to container. Enables access to external files.
   docker run --rm -it image                       # Uses only internal container files. No access to host system.
   optional(/bin/bash -c "commands")               # Spawn Bash shell that immediately runs command string passed as argument.
	```
-v $PWD:/wdr → Mounts current directory into container at /wdr
-w /wdr → Sets working directory inside container

## ⚖️ Copy vs Mount
-COPY → Adds files during build (static snapshot)
-MOUNT → Shares files during run (dynamic access)

## 📜 Dockerfile Commands

| Command      | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| FROM         | Specifies base image                             |
| COPY         | Copies files from host into image                |
| ADD          | Downloads files from URLs                        |
| RUN          | Executes commands during image build             |
| CMD          | Default command to run in container              |
| ENTRYPOINT   | Fixed command that can't be overridden           |
| MAINTAINER   | Author of the Dockerfile                         |
| WORKDIR      | Sets working directory inside container          |

## 🧱 Docker Architecture

| Layer           | Role                                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Client          | Sends commands (build, pull, run)                 |
| Docker Host     | Runs Docker daemon (manages images & containers) |
| Registry / Hub  | Stores static images (e.g., Docker Hub)          |

## ⚙️ Docker Engine Components

| Component       | Role                                               |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Server          | Manages images, containers, volumes, networks      |
| REST API        | Interface between client and server                |
| Client (CLI)    | Command-line tool to interact with Docker          |

## ☁️ Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry for storing and sharing Docker images.

### Common Commands
```bash
docker run     # Run a container
docker pull    # Download image
docker ps      # List running containers
docker stop    # Stop a container
docker start   # Start a container
docker login   # Authenticate with Docker Hub
```

## 🧩 Docker Objects

| Object          | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Image           | Read-only template for containers                |
| Container       | Executable instance of an image                  |
| Volume          | Persistent data storage shared across containers |
| Storage Driver  | Low-level mechanism for managing container filesystems |
| Network         | Connects containers to each other and the outside world |

|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Create volume    | Allocates space on host filesystem               |
| Mount volume     | Integrates volume into container FS              |
| Read/write data  | Manages how data is stored/retrieved            |
