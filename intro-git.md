## 🗂️ GIT REPOSITORY

| Command        | Superpower |
|----------------|------------|
| `git init`     | Creates a `.git` directory in the folder and turns it into a Git repo—start a fresh repository. |
| `git remote add alias_repo URL` | Links the local repository to a remote URL (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). |
| `git clone`    | Copies the entire setup (commits, branches, files) from a remote repo into the machine. |
Every git enviroment has its branch with history.

## 🌿 BRANCH

Branches are generated by default when creating a new repository.

### Types
```bash
git branch       # Shows local branches
git branch -r    # Shows remote branches
git branch -a    # Shows all branches
```

### Configuration
```bash
git branch -M main                # Rename current branch to 'main'
git branch -m master main         # Rename branch 'master' to 'main'
git checkout new_branch           # Switch to a new branch
```
Combination: `git checkout -b local_branch remote_alias/remote_branch` creates local_branch. sets it to track remote_branch. copies commit history. switches to local_branch

### Operation
```bash
git branch new_branch                  # Create local branch
git branch -d branch-name              # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete branch-name   # Delete remote branch
```

## 🌍 Local vs Remote Branches

| Concept       | Local Branch       | Remote Branch         |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Location      | Your machine        | Remote server (e.g., GitHub) |
| Created By    | `git checkout -b`   | `git push` from local  |
| Shared?       | No (until pushed)   | Yes (visible to others) |
| Updated By    | `git commit`        | `git push` / `git fetch` |
current branch - repo_alias/HEAD

## 🚀 PUSH

Push is allowed only if the local branch is ahead of the remote.
Git push command pushes commits, files, history from LOCAL to REMOTE branch.

### Typical workflow
```bash
git status
git add changes                          # stage files
git commit -m "your message"             # record and add snapshot to default local_branch (create) or specified one (apply) 
git push -u repo_alias branch            # push local to remote and set tracking
git push --force ... ... ...             # overwrite the remote_branch with the local_branch
```
Git add + git commit creates a local branch.

---

## 📦 SUBPUSH

### Split and push a subdirectory
```bash
git subtree split -P path_to_directory -b new_branch
git ls-tree -r --name-only new_branch_name              # list files and directories in a branch
git push repo_alias new_branch:main                     # local_branch:remote_branch
```
Creates a subtree split for the directory and pushes that split as a separate branch named `main`.

---

## 🔄 REQUEST

### Non-intrusive: Fetch updates
```bash
git fetch repo_alias branch
```
Grabs new commits from the remote without merging—like observing quietly.

git stash stach the local changes

### Streamlined Update: Fetch + Rebase
```bash
git rebase repo_alias/remote_branch
```
Rewrites the local branch by reaplying the commits on top of remote branch. The history is linear (rewritten).

### Traditional Update: Fetch + Merge
```bash
git merge repo_alias/remote_branch
```
Create a new merge commit in the local branch by combining the changes from both banches. The history includes merge commits (preserved).


### Full update: Pull = Fetch + Merge
```bash
git pull remote_alias branch
```
Brings remote changes into your current branch—fetches and merges together.
It assumes the local repo has a local branch already.

## 📚 LOG
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all branch_name

```
| Flag           | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--oneline`    | Displays each commit as a single concise line.               |
| `--graph`      | Adds an ASCII graph showing branches and merges.             |
| `--decorate`   | Shows branch names and tags next to commit messages.         |
| `--all`        | Includes commits from all branches, not just the current one.|

## 🏁 Repository Creation Examples

### Option 1: Create a new repo and push
```bash
echo "" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add repo_alias repo-url
git push -u repo_alias main
```

### Option 2: Push an existing repository
```bash
git remote add repo_alias repo-url
git branch -M main
git push -u repo_alias main
```
